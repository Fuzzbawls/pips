People wishing to submit PIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the PIVX forum. After discussion they should email Fuzzbawls &lt;fuzzbawls@gmail.com&gt;. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with adding PIPs here, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a PIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a PIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community, which is typically (but not always) in the form of a passing budget proposal.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the PIVX users
